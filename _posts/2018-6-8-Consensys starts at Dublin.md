Kehoe is also a firm believer in the way that Ethereum works with other companies. **“Rather than on a time and materials basis, we look to work hand in hand with the individual**. So, we’ll say, ‘we’ll help build it,’ and we ask for equity, we invest in the idea, as opposed to being a consulting house. We won’t charge them loads of money, but in return for that we would like equity in the solution.”

**“The company is much like the technology, in that it’s extremely decentralized.** There are probably few things that I’d get fired for, but if I started acting like a boss and telling people what to do, I don’t think I’d be in the job long. We are incredibly flat, everyone is respected. We try our best to hire smart people, and if we hire smart people, they don’t need to be managed. If we bring people in and show them a range of opportunities then people will be passionate about what they do.”

**TLDR:**

Almost 300 companies are already trying to build, regulate, define or integrate DLT, through participation in consortia or pilots of their own. Ambition with regards to the type use cases differs though, with most sticking to simple cost plays. Companies have not yet put blockchain into large-scale production, at least for financial services and manufacturing this is expected to change over the course of 2018 though.

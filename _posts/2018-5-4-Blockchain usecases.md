## Blockchain Expectations in 2018

- The IoT will run on multiple blockchains and will give rise to an M2M economy. This can include energy devices, autonomous cars, and house hold accessories.
Medical records will be shared securely while preserving the privacy of patients between various private blockchains run by consortia of health providers. It may well be a single private blockchain shared among all service providers including pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics.
- Elections will be held via decentralized web applications with a backend of blockchains transparently and securely.
- Financial institutions will be running many private blockchains to share data between participants and for internal processes.
- Financial institutions will be making use of semiprivate blockchains that will provide identity information for AML and KYC functions and will be shared between many or all of the financial institutions around the world.
Immigration and border control related activities will be recorded on the blockchain and passport control will be conducted via a blockchain shared between all ports of entries and border agencies around the world.
Governments will run interdepartmental blockchain to provide government services such as pension disbursement, benefit disbursement, land ownership records, birth registrations and other citizen services. This way auditability, trust and sense of security will develop among citizens.
- Research in cryptography and distributed systems will reach new heights and universities, and educational establishment will offer dedicated courses on cryptoeconomics, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains.
- Artificially Intelligent DAOs will prevail on blockchains that will make rational decisions on behalf of humans.
- A publicly available regulated blockchain run by the government will be used on day-to-day basis by citizens to perform their day-to-day activities, for example tax payments, TV license registration and marriage registrations.
BaaS will be provided as standard to anyone who wishes to run their business or day-to-day transactions on a blockchain. In fact, it could be envisaged that just like the Internet, blockchains will seamlessly integrate into our daily lives and people will be using them without knowing much about the underlying technology and infrastructure.
- Blockchains will normally be used to provide Digital Rights Management (DRM) services for arts and media and can be used to deliver content to the consumers, enabling direct communication between consumer and the producer. This will eliminate the need for any central party to govern the licensing and rights managing of valuable goods.
- Existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will continue to grow in value, and with the availability of state channels and scalability efforts, this trend is only expected to grow.
- Cryptocurrency investment will greatly increase, and a new cryptoeconomic society will emerge.
- Bitcoin value will reach tens of thousands of dollars per coin.
- Digital identities will be routinely managed on the blockchain, and different government functions such as voting, taxation, and funds disbursement will be conducted via blockchain-enabled platforms.
- Financial institutions and clearing houses will start to introduce blockchain-based solutions for their customers in 2018.

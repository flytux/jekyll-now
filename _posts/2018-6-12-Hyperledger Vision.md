Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are often discussed in similar contexts, but they are not one in the same.
Distributed ledgers do not require a cryptocurrency to work.
Cryptocurrency encompasses an anonymous record of who owns what tokens. Token exchanges create new entries on the ledger. 
Blockchains prevent the same token from being spent twice.
Many open source blockchain efforts implement cryptocurrency as a means to fund mining and participation in consensus. 
However, the most popular existing blockchains like Bitcoin [Nak08] and Ethereum [But13] utilize completely trustless networks and permissionless chains.
Permisionless networks present tremendous challenges and not all of them technical as debates rise over the roles these platforms should play in society and who should govern them.

**Permissioned blockchains differ from what you’ll find in Bitcoin or Ethereum.**
Most enterprise blockchain applications rely upon real world trust relationships, wherein the goal is to set up a set of participants in an ecosystem with the needed insurance that
the boundaries are flexible enough to bring in more participants in the future. 
Participants on a permissioned network are known to one another, and therefore have an intrinsic interest in participating in the consensus making
process. 
**This community of participants want to share data with a greater degree of security. Without needing to run proof of work mechanisms, they can resolve more immediate
problems than on a public cryptocurrency blockchain.**
This is why you’re seeing every financial business looking to get involved in business blockchain technologies.
